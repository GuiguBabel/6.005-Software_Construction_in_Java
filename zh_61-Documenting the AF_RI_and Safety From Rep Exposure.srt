1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,750
最好记录抽象函数
It's good practice to document the abstraction function

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,714
在类中使用注释表示不变量
and rep invariant in the class using comments

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:07,380
这就是声明rep的私有字段的地方。
that are right where the private fields of the rep are declared.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,420
我们已经在上面做了。
We've already been doing that above.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,920
另一份我们要你写的文件
Another piece of documentation that we'll ask you to write

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,890
是一个代表暴露安全的论点。
is a rep exposure safety argument.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,820
这是一条评论，它检查了销售代表的每个部分，
This is a comment that examines each part of the rep,

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,116
查看处理该rep部分的代码--
looks at the code that handles that part of the rep--

9
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:23,490
尤其是在参数和返回值方面
particularly with respect to parameters and return values

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,470
从客户那里，因为那是代表曝光的地方--
from clients because that's where rep exposure occurs--

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,061
并给出代码不公开rep的原因。
and presents a reason why the code doesn't expose the rep.

12
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:34,050
下面是一个带有rep不变量的tweet示例
Here's an example of tweet with its rep invariant

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,540
从重复暴露中提取功能和安全性
abstraction function and safety from rep exposure

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,110
完全记录在案。
fully documented.

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,500
这是它的rep不变量。
Here is its rep invariant.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,410
上面说作者是Twitter用户名，
It says that the author is a Twitter username,

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,070
定义了这意味着什么，它还说
defines what that means, It also says

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,430
tweet的长度小于或等于140个字符。
that the tweet is less than or equal to 140 characters long.

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,050
它的抽象功能是
And its abstraction function says

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,010
它代表了一条微博
that it represents a tweet posted

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,170
作者用文字的内容
by that author with the content of text

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,390
在时间戳上。
at the time time-stamped.

24
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,430
它有一个关于避免暴露在公众面前的安全性的论点。
And it has an argument for safety from rep exposure.

25
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,270
所有的田地都是私人的。
All the fields are private.

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,600
作者和文本是字符串，所以它们是
Author and text are strings, so they're

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,890
保证是不变的。
guaranteed to be immutable.

28
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,220
时间戳是可变日期。
Time stamp is a mutable date.

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,000
所以tweet构造函数可以得到时间戳，
So the tweet constructor can get time stamp,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,240
制作防御副本以避免共享销售代表的数据
make defensive copies to avoid sharing the rep's data

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,380
反对客户。
object with clients.

32
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,600
现在，注意我们没有任何显式的rep不变量
Now, notice we don't have any explicit rep invariant

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,140
时间戳的条件
conditions on time stamp aside from

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,500
时间戳不是
the conventional assumption that time stamp is not

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,770
等于空，我们对所有对象引用都有空。
equal to null, which we have for all object references.

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,950
但我们还需要在广告曝光中加入时间戳
But we still need to include time stamp in the rep exposure

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,870
安全参数，因为不变性属性
safety argument because the immutability property

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,080
整个类型的依赖于保持不变的所有字段。
of the whole type depends on all the fields remaining unchanged.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,940
以下是拉特南的论点--
Here are the arguments for ratnam--

41
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:59,240
它的代表不变量，它的抽象函数，
its rep invariant, its abstraction function,

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,110
以及它的安全性。
and its safety from rep exposure.

43
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,130
所有字段都是私有的。
All fields are private.

44
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,940
代表中的所有类型都是不可变的。
All types in the rep are immutable.

45
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,180
所以请注意，一个不变的代表特别容易争论
So notice that an immutable rep is particularly easy to argue

46
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,549
为了避免重复暴露。
for safety from rep exposure.
