1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,849
本课程的主要目标是
Our primary goal in this course is

2
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:03,390
学习如何制作
to learn how to produce software that

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,690
是安全的，容易理解，
is safe from bugs, easy to understand,

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,500
准备好改变。
and ready for change.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,690
这是什么意思？
And what do we mean by that?

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,200
好吧，免受虫害意味着它的行为是正确的
Well, safe from bugs means that it behaves correctly

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,390
现在，但同时也是防御性的，
right now, but also that it's defensive,

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,260
它能防止将来可能出现的虫子。
that it guards against bugs that might crop up in the future.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,010
容易理解意味着你
Easy to understand means that you're

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,520
能够与未来的程序员沟通
able to communicate to future programmers who

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,520
需要理解并修改代码，
need to understand and make changes to the code,

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,900
比如修复错误或者添加新功能。
like fixing bugs or adding new features.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,540
未来的程序员可能就是你。
A future programmer might actually be you.

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,220
如果你不写的话你会很惊讶你会忘记
You'd be surprised how much you forget if you don't write it

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,080
对你未来的自己有多大的帮助
down and how much it helps your own future self to have

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,110
一个好的代码设计。
a good design in your code.

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,740
准备好改变意味着你的软件已经准备好了
And ready for change means that your software is ready

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,190
对于新功能，请更改其周围的环境。
for new features, changes in the environment around it.

19
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,430
软件总是变化的。
Software always changes.

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,730
有些设计使这些改变变得容易。
Some designs make it easy to make those changes.

21
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,570
另一些则需要扔掉并重写大量代码，
Others require throwing away and rewriting a lot of code,

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,292
这不好。
and that's not good.

23
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,500
现在软件还有其他重要的特性，
Now there are other important properties of software,

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,020
比如它的运行速度，可用性
like how fast it runs, how usable

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,170
对于最终用户来说，这是多么的安全。
it is for end users, how secure it is against attackers.

26
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,489
他们可能会和这三个人交换。
And they may trade off against these three.

27
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,520
但这是6005年我们关心的三大问题。
But these are the big three that we care about in 6005.

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,510
我们会一遍又一遍地讨论这些问题。
We'll come back to these over and over.

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,940
软件开发人员通常把这些放在首位
Software developers generally put these foremost

30
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,870
在构建软件的实践中。
in the practice of building software.

31
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,860
每种语言都值得思考
It's worth thinking about every language

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,220
特性，每一个编程实践，每一个设计
feature, every programming practice, and every design

33
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,320
模式，我们在这门课上学习的每一个想法
pattern, every idea that we study in this course

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,300
了解他们与三巨头的关系。
and understanding how they relate to the big three.

35
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,216
每次阅读结束后我们都会这么做。
And we'll do that at the end of every reading.

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,970
为什么这门课是用Java教的
Now why is this course taught in Java rather

38
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,480
而不是Python和JavaScript？
than Python and JavaScript?

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,170
一个原因是安全。
Well, one reason is safety.

40
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,180
Java有静态检查。
Java has static checking.

41
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,760
主要是静态类型检查
Primarily, it's static-type checking

42
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,551
但是还有其他类型的静态检查，
but there are other kinds of static checks,

43
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,600
同样，你的代码必须从
too, like your code has to return values from methods that

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,597
期望返回值。
are expected to return values.

45
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:45,930
因为我们在这门课上学习软件工程
Since we're studying software engineering in this course

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,060
安全性是这种方法的一个关键原则，
and safety from bugs is a key tenet of that approach,

47
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,465
Java拨号安全性高达11，因此
Java dials safety up to 11 so it makes

48
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,090
它是学习优秀软件工程的好语言
it a good language for learning about good software engineering

49
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,810
实践。
practices.

50
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,860
现在当然可以编写安全的代码了
Now it's certainly possible to write safe code

51
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,724
在Python这样的动态语言中，
in dynamic languages like Python,

52
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,140
但更容易理解
but it's easier to understand what

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,930
如果你先学会如何
you need to do if you first learn how

54
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,830
用一种安全的静态检查语言。
in a safe statically-checked language.

55
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,150
另一个原因是无处不在。
Another reason is ubiquity.

56
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,120
Java广泛应用于研究、教育和工业领域。
Java's widely used in research, education, and industry.

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,600
它运行在许多平台上，不仅仅是Windows、Mac和Linux。
It runs on many platforms, not just Windows, Mac, and Linux.

58
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,100
它可以用于网络编程，
It can be used for web programming,

59
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,480
在服务器和客户端
both in the server and the client

60
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,634
以及本地安卓程序。
and for native Android programming.

61
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,800
尽管其他编程语言更好
Although other programming languages are much better

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,140
适合于编程、Scheme和ML的教学
suited to teaching programming, Scheme and ML

63
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,780
是优秀教学语言的好例子，
are good examples of good teaching languages,

64
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,430
不幸的是，这些语言不是
unfortunately these languages are not

65
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,250
广泛存在于现实世界中。
widespread in the real world.

66
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,010
你简历上的Java将被识别
Java on your resume will be recognized

67
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,390
作为一种可销售的技能，Scheme和ML不会。
as a marketable skill, Scheme and ML will not.

68
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,515
不过，别误会我们。
Don't get us wrong, though.

69
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:39,306
你从这门课上学到的真正技能
The real skills you'll get from this course

70
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:41,180
不是Java特有的。
are not Java-specific.

71
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,140
它们可以传递到任何你可以编程的语言中。
They carry over to any language that you might program in.

72
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,020
这门课最重要的一课
The most important lessons from this course

73
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,250
会在这些语言风潮中幸存下来，
will survive these language fads,

74
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,240
安全、清晰、抽象和直觉
safety, clarity, abstraction, and instinct

75
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,934
为了更好的工程。
for good engineering.

76
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,350
无论如何，一个好的程序员
And in any case, a good programmer

77
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,375
必须是多语言的。
must be multilingual.

78
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,380
编程语言是工具。
Programming languages are tools.

79
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,344
你必须使用正确的工具来做这项工作。
You have to use the right tool for the job.

80
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,760
如果你是一个实践程序员，
If you're a practicing programmer,

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,843
你一定要学其他程序
you'll certainly have to pick up other programming

82
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:04,940
未来的语言。
languages in the future.

83
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,400
所以现在就开始学习第二个吧。
So get started now by learning a second one.

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,980
现在由于它的普遍性，Java
Now as a result of its ubiquity, Java

85
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,480
有很多有趣和有用的库，
has a wide array of interesting and useful libraries,

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,434
都在巨大的内置图书馆里
both in its enormous built-in library

87
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,100
以及网上的其他图书馆。
and also other libraries out on the net.

88
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
它有优秀的免费开发工具，
And it has excellent free tools for development,

89
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,270
像Eclipse，我们将使用它。
like Eclipse, which we'll be using.

90
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,850
即使是Python本身也有一个巨大的库，
Even Python, which has an enormous library itself,

91
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,430
在丰富的生态系统方面仍然落后于Java。
is still behind Java in the richness of its ecosystem.

92
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,560
现在有一些理由后悔使用Java。
Now there's some reasons to regret using Java.

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,050
它非常冗长，这使得我们的例子写得更长
It's very wordy, which makes our examples longer to write

94
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,300
更难阅读。
and harder to read.

95
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,030
它像语言一样大。
It's large as a language.

96
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,460
它有许多特点。
It has many features.

97
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,810
内部矛盾。
It's internally inconsistent.

98
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,860
例如，我们已经
For example, the final keyword that we've already

99
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,680
谈论实际上意味着不同的事情
talked about actually means different things

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,596
在不同的背景下。
in different contexts.

101
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:47,490
静态关键字，我们还没说太多，
And the static keyword, which we haven't said much about yet,

102
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,220
与静态检查无关。
has nothing to do with static checking.

103
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,850
Java被旧语言的包袱压得喘不过气来，
Java is weighted with the baggage of older languages,

104
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,460
像C和C++一样。
like C and C++.

105
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,560
所以原始类型和switch语句
So the primitive types and the switch statement

106
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,010
都是很好的例子。
are good examples of that.

107
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,990
它没有像Python那样的解释器，我们可以简单地
And it has no interpreter like Python's, where we can simply

108
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,365
输入一点代码，看看它们是怎么做的。
type in little bits of code and see what they do.

109
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:07,740
但总的来说，Java是一种合理的语言选择
But on the whole, Java is a reasonable choice of language

110
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,800
现在要学习如何编写安全的代码，
right now to learn how to write code that is safe from bugs,

111
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,690
更容易理解，随时准备改变。
easier to understand, and ready for change.

112
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,100
这将是我们的目标。
And that's going to be our goal.
