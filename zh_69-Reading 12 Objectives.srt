在这篇文章中，我们将仔细观察
In this reading, we're going to look closely

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,350
如何定义抽象数据的相等操作
at how to define the equality operation for an abstract data

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,136
键入。
type.

4
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:07,510
读完这篇文章，你应该
After this reading, you should be

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,180
能够理解平等的定义
able to understand equality defined

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,470
就抽象功能而言，
in terms of the abstraction function,

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,805
作为等价关系，或作为观察。
as an equivalence relation, or as observations.

8
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:17,530
你也应该能够区分参考文献
You should also be able to differentiate between reference

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,520
平等与客体平等与区分
equality and object equality and differentiate

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,900
在严格的观测相等之间
between strict observational equality

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,020
以及可变类型的行为平等。
and behavioral equality for mutable types.

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,600
你应该能理解目标合同
And you should be able to understand the object contract

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,710
在Java中，能够正确实现等式
in Java and be able to implement equality correctly

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,910
对于可变和不可变类型。
for both mutable and immutable types.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,770
我们开始吧。
Let's get started.
