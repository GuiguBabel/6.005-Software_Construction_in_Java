1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,035
欢迎使用Java进行软件构建。
Welcome to software construction in Java.

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:04,410
在我们的第一次朗读中，我们将
In this first reading we're going

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,240
来谈谈Java的一个重要特性，即
to talk about an important feature of Java that

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,365
使其有别于其他编程语言
makes it different from other programming languages

5
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:10,850
您可能已经学过了，比如Python和JavaScript。
you may have learned, like Python and JavaScript.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,660
该功能称为静态类型。
That feature is called static typing.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,930
接下来，我们将介绍本课程的三大目标。
From there, we'll introduce the three big goals of this course.

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,180
因为这门课程并不是真正的Java编程课程，
Because this course isn't really a Java programming course,

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,900
我们想学习如何编写好的代码
we want to learn how to write good code

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,380
用任何语言和三大理念
in any language and the three big ideas

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,940
是关于我们所说的好代码的意思。
are about what we mean by good code.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,410
首先，它应该是安全的，不会有错误--或者换句话说，它应该是安全的
First it should be safe from bugs-- or in other words

13
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,409
正确--第二，应该很容易理解
correct-- two, it should be easy to understand

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,540
由其他程序员，第三，它
by other programmers, and three, it

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,240
应该准备好在未来被改变。
should be ready to be changed in the future.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,180
本课程中的每个想法都将有助于实现这些目标。
Every idea in this course is going to help with these goals.

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,160
让我来介绍一下这门课程的阅读材料。
Let me also say something about the readings for this course.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,520
阅读的每个部分都有一个正文部分
Each section of a reading has a text part

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,470
外加一个视频部分，在这个部分里，我基本上
plus a video part in which I basically

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,060
把课文通读一遍。
read through the text.

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,750
文本和视频在其中都具有相同的信息，
The text and the video both have the same information in them,

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,690
所以你可以忘了录像带
so you can just forget about the video

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,954
如果你愿意的话，只要读课文就行了
and just read the text if you prefer to do that

24
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:58,870
或者您可以在滚动的同时收听视频
or you can listen to the video while scrolling

25
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,360
或者你可以直接看视频
through the text or you can just watch the video

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,795
并在开始时忽略文本。
and ignore the text at first.

27
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,920
但如果您稍后需要参考该部分，
But if you need to refer back to the section later,

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,610
你可能会发现课文部分更容易些
you may find the text part easier

29
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,100
浏览、搜索和评论。
to skim and search and review.

30
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,360
好了，我们开始吧。
OK, let's get started.
