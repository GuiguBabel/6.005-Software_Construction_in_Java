1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,290
好的，我们有计算冰雹序列的代码
OK, so we've got our code that computes a hailstone sequence

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,524
并将其放入列表中。
and puts it into a list.

3
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:10,190
现在为了使它成为一个完整的Java程序
Now in order to make this a full Java program there's a few more

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,080
我们需要补充的东西。
things we need to add.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,970
因为每一句话，所有这些话
Because every statement, all these statements

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,840
需要在方法声明中，
need to be inside a method declaration,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,545
每个方法都需要在某个类中。
and every method needs to be in some class.

8
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,170
所以这是最简单的方法
So this is the simplest way that we can

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,336
写我们的冰雹计划。
write our hailstone program.

10
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,080
我们接受这个密码。
We take this code.

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,690
我们把它包在一个方法里。
We wrap it inside a method.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,000
下面是这种方法的外观。
And here's how the outside of that method looks.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,210
所以这是一种叫做冰雹序列的方法。
So it's a method named Hailstone Sequence.

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,670
接受一个必须具有声明类型的参数。
Takes one argument that has to have a declared type.

15
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,290
在这种情况下，我们开始的是整数n
In this case, it's the integer n that we're starting

16
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,840
冰雹序列。
the hailstone sequence with.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,440
它必须有一个声明的返回类型。
And it has to have a declared return type.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,885
在本例中，是整数列表
In this case, it's the list of integers that

19
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,070
是冰雹序列吗。
is that hailstone sequence.

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,810
我一会儿再谈这两个关键词。
And I'll talk about these two key words in a moment.

21
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,659
但是函数还需要返回一些
But then the function also needs to return something

22
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,075
这与报税表相符
that's compatible with that return

23
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,910
类型，它有正确的类型。
type, that has the right type.

24
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,750
所以我们将返回我们创建的列表。
So we're going to return this list that we've created.

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,190
然后这个方法需要在一个类中。
And then that method needs to be inside a class.

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,440
我们叫我们班冰雹。
And we're calling our class hailstone.

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,290
这就是我们申报的方式。
And this is how we declare it.

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,850
我们把所有东西都放在大括号里
We put everything in curly braces

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,822
为了展示街区。
in order to show the blocks.

30
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,530
现在这里有什么新鲜事？
Now what are some of the new things here?

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,729
公开一个类和方法
So public with a class and in the method

32
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,520
意味着程序中的任何代码
means that any code anywhere in the program

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,500
允许引用此方法或此类。
is allowed to refer to this method or this class.

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,600
我们将看到其他一些访问修饰符，如private
We're going to see some other access modifiers like private

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,770
我们可以用它来保证程序的安全性
that we can use to get more safety in a program

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,470
在我们需要的时候保证不变性
and to guarantee immutability when we want

37
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,000
编写不可变类型。
to write an immutable type.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,460
但我们将在接下来的阅读中讨论更多。
But we'll talk about that more in upcoming readings.

39
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,170
其他的新东西，静态的，意味着
Other new thing here, static, means

40
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,200
这个方法，冰雹序列方法，
that this method, this hailstone sequence method,

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,550
不会被调用对象，不会
doesn't get called on an object, doesn't

42
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,380
需要有一个自参数。
need to have a self-parameter.

43
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,200
顺便说一下，self是Java中Python中的单词。
By the way self is the word in Python in Java.

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,950
这叫这个。
This is called this.

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,130
因此不能对对象调用静态方法。
So static methods can't be called on an object.

46
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,560
例如，与列表相比，
Contrast that with the list, for example,

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,500
这里的list add方法。
the list add method here.

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,490
我们调用的是一个列表的特定值。
Which we're calling on a particular value of a list.

49
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,310
当我们调用冰雹序列时，
When we'd call a hailstone sequence,

50
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,730
我们不会以任何特定的价值来衡量
we wouldn't call it on any particular value

51
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,030
冰雹级的。
of the hailstone class.

52
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,979
我们不会制造一个新的价值冰雹类。
We wouldn't make a new value hailstone class.

53
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,430
我们会用类名来表示
We would just use the class name to say

54
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,440
我们得去看冰雹课
we need to go and look in the hailstone class

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,530
找到冰雹序列的方法。
and find the hailstone sequence method inside there.

56
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,420
事实上如果这段代码是
In fact if this code were written

57
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,010
在冰雹层里，我们甚至
inside this hailstone class, we wouldn't even

58
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,330
需要提到类本身。
need to mention the class itself.

59
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,660
因为我们早就到了。
Because we'd already be there.

60
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,190
它就可以搜索冰雹序列
It would just be able to search for hailstone sequence

61
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,987
在我们现在所在的班级里。
within the class we're currently in.

62
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,570
还有一件事我想指出
Another thing I want to point out here

63
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,999
这个注释在方法之前吗。
is this comment right before the method.

64
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,290
因为这很重要。
Because this is very important.

65
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,720
这个评论就是这个方法的规范，
This comment is the specification of that method,

66
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,000
描述输入和输出
describes the inputs and the output

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,520
在某种程度上，一个人在看这个代码
in ways that a human being looking at this code

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,630
很容易理解。
can easily understand.

69
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,850
所以他们不必研究代码本身
So they don't have to study the code itself

70
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,940
为了弄清楚这到底是怎么回事。
in order to figure out what this actually does.

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,110
但也有一些限制，
But also providing some constraints,

72
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,090
一些假设，代码本身没有显示。
some assumptions, that the code itself does not show.

73
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,530
所以这实际上需要冰雹序列
So this actually requires, the hailstone sequence

74
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,184
要求我们从正整数开始。
requires that we're starting with a positive integer.

75
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,600
因为如果我们不从一个正整数开始
Because if we don't start with a positive integer actually

76
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,550
坏事会发生。
bad things can happen.

77
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,680
我们可以永远跑下去。
And we can definitely run forever.

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,960
所以这个注释被称为规范。
So this comment is called the specification.

79
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,010
我们将在以后的课上更多地讨论这个问题。
We're going to talk a lot more about that in future classes.
