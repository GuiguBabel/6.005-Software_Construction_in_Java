1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,850
我们的下一个原则是避免使用神奇的数字。
Our next principle is avoiding magic numbers.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,962
那么什么是神奇数字？
So what's a magic number?

3
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:07,420
在计算机科学中只有两个数字
Well, there are really only two numbers in computer science

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,210
首先。
to begin with.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,330
0和1。
0 and 1.

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,970
我们也可以允许2。
We could also allow 2.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,100
但是所有其他的数字和常数
But all other numbers and constants in general

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,060
被称为魔法如果他们自己出现没有名字。
are called magic if they appear by themselves without names.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,340
所以一年中的每一天都充满了这些神奇的数字。
So day of year is full of these magic numbers.

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,970
我们在这里看到2，在这里看到31，在这里看到3，
We see a 2 here, we see a 31 here, we see a 3 here,

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,410
59号。
59 there.

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,438
这些是魔法，因为代码无法解释它们的含义，
These are magic because the code doesn't explain what they mean,

13
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:34,354
他们代表什么，来自哪里。
what they represent, and where they came from.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,820
修复幻数的一种方法是
One way to fix magic number is to make

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,790
更可读的代码是替换那些未命名的常量
code more readable is to replace those unnamed constants

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,240
使用命名常量。
with named constants.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,480
所以这个数字是2，因为它实际上
So this number here, 2, because it actually

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,320
代表二月，
is supposed to represent February,

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,820
如果它真的
would be much clearer if it actually

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,550
是一个叫二月的常数。
was a constant named February.

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,540
这些数字代表了一个月的几天，
For these numbers that represent the days of the month,

23
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,560
实际上，最好将它们放入数组中。
it would actually better to put them into an array.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,240
一个命名数组，比如月长，
A named array, like month's length,

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,620
然后你就可以索引这个月的数字。
that you can then index on the number of the month.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,520
这些神奇的数字特别糟糕，因为它们
These magic numbers are particularly bad because they

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,470
由程序员手工计算
are computed by hand by the programmer

28
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,260
在没有任何解释的情况下
and just dropped into this code without any explanation of what

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,900
计算是产生它们的原因。
the computation was that produced them.

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,780
这几乎不是个好主意。
This is almost never a good idea.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,270
不要用手工和硬计算常数
Don't compute constants by hand and hard

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,795
把它们编码成你的代码。
code them into your code.

33
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,420
首先，因为编程语言
First, because the programming language

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,878
会比你更擅长算术的，
is going to be much better at that arithmetic than you are,

35
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:32,230
所以你应该把算术放进去。
so you should just put the arithmetic in there.

36
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,090
但是第二，因为它会更清晰
But second, because it will be clearer

37
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,070
给你看完的维修人员
to the maintainer coming after you reading it

38
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,800
59是从哪里来的。
where that 59 came from.

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,700
实际上是一月份的总和
That it's actually the sum of the length of January

40
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,600
还有二月的长度。
and the length of February.

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,050
所以不要用魔法数字。
So don't use magic numbers.

42
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,188
用名字好多了。
It's much better to use names.
