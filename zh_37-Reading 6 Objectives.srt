00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,460
今天的阅读主题是调试。
The topic of today's reading is debugging.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,540
或者更确切地说，如何避免完全调试，或者至少
Or rather how to avoid debugging entirely, or at least

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,170
当你不得不做的时候要保持轻松。
to keep it easy when you have to do it.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,960
我们将讨论两个一般的方法
We're going to talk about two general ways

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,890
以避免痛苦的调试。
to avoid painful debugging.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,582
首先，通过设计使错误变得不可能。
First, making bugs impossible by design.

7
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,540
我们将回顾一些我们已经掌握的技术
We'll review some techniques that we've already

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,210
静态检查，动态检查，
talked about, static checking, dynamic checking,

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,580
以及不变性。
and immutability.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,930
第二，将bug定位到程序的一小部分
Second, localizing bugs to a small part of the program

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,230
这样就更容易找到虫子了。
so that finding the bug becomes easier.

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,950
我们会看到一些新的想法，主张，
We'll see some new ideas for this, assertions,

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,680
增量开发和范围最小化。
incremental development, and scope minimization.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,920
好吧，我们开始吧。
OK, let's get started.
