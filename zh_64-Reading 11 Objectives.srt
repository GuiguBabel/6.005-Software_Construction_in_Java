今天的阅读主题是界面--
The topic of today's reading is interfaces--

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,520
分离抽象数据类型的接口
separating the interface of an abstract data type

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,320
从它的实现和使用Java接口类型
from its implementation and using Java interface types that

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,762
强制分离。
enforce that separation.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,220
今天的阅读之后你应该
After today's reading you should be

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,750
能够用接口定义抽象数据类型
able to define abstract data types with interfaces

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,190
编写实现这些接口的类。
and write classes that implement those interfaces.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,120
我们开始吧。
Let's get started.
